  <h2 class="slogan">Interesting Facts</h2>
  <p>During the early stages of creation, Izuku was known as
    Mikumo Akatani. He had a long curly hairstyle and his bangs covered
    his eyes. He was also quirkless, relying more on homemade gadgets and
    luck to overcome obstacles. His hero costume was a little more
    intimidating. However, Horikoshi, the manga's author, noted that he
    was unhappy with Mikumo's design, especially his hair. This forced
    the mangaka to come up with the current design with a slightly
    shorter hairstyle.
    <p>Izuku's name contains the kanji for "green" (緑), "valley"
      (谷), "to come from/be from a certain place" (出), and "long ago" (久).

        as he is the ninth user of One For All.</p>

          The derisive nickname "Deku" was given to him by Katsuki in early
          childhood.It is Ochako who finds the nickname inspiring because

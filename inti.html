  <h2 class="slogan-text">General Abilities</h2>
  <p>
  Combat Skills: Izuku has decent fighting skills and physical attributes
above the average student. However, he improved his physical
capabilities through training, which was enough to provide valuable
assistance during his battle with the Stain. He usually relied on his
fists to attack, however he decided to change his fighting style based
on his kicks, which are stronger than his arms.</p>
<p>Keen Mind: Izuku has proven to be extremely smart on many occasions.
   He showed deep observation and analysis skills. Typically, his
    intelligence helped him more than his Quirk. Izuku is able to
    formulate tactics to gain an advantage in a situation and uses his
    knowledge to creatively utilize other people's Quirks to their
    fullest, such as working with Tsuyu and Minoru to escape with them
    from the villains in the flood zone in the U.S.J.. Izuku also has
    extensive knowledge about Professional Heroes and their Quirks.
    Thanks to Izuku's intelligence, he figured out the mechanics of
    One For All, allowing him to use his Quirk more effectively in a
     short period of time. Gran Torino even praised Izuku's
     intelligence, saying that Izuku is a person who thinks before he
     acts.</p>
     <p>High Pain Threshold: On many occasions, Izuku has demonstrated
       that he can tolerate large amounts of pain. This is mainly due to
        Quirk abuse; however, he was able to move despite feeling
        excruciating pain.</p>
        <h2 class="slogan-text">Fighting techniques</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Detroit Punch (デトロイトスマッシュ Detoroito Sumasshu):
             The same move as All Might's, but performed by Izuku as
              an uppercut.</li>
              <li>Delaware Punch (デラウエアスマッュ Derauea Sumasshu): Izuku
                makes a "snap" with his fingers, creating a shock wave.
                 The punch comes out so strong that Izuku's fingers break,
                  due to which he cannot use this move more than 10 times in
                  a fight. However, in emergency cases, he can perform this
                  technique even with broken fingers, causing severe injuries
                  to them.</li>
                  <li>One For All: Full Coverage (ワン・フォー・オール フルカウル
                    Wan Fō Ōru Furukauru): Izuku passes a certain percentage of
                    One For All's power through his body on a permanent basis
                    rather than momentarily like the moves above, allowing him to
                    last longer fight and don't break your bones. This method of
                    using his quirk gives him greater agility. Activating this
                    technique grants him increased strength, speed, mobility, and
                    agility.</li>
                    <li>One For All 100%: A technique that allows Izuku to attack
                      using the full power of his quirk in the desired part of his
                      body, followed by severe damage to it. Continued use of the
                      same limb after one such attack can cause fractures, as seen
                      in his fights against Shoto Todoroki (resulting in Izuku having
                      surgery on his right arm) and muscle tears (resulting in several
                      scars on his right arm).</li>
                      <li>One For All: Full Cover - Side Style
                        (ワンフォーオール フルカウル シュートスタイル Wan Fō Ōru Furu Kauru
                        Shūto Sutairu): By activating One For All Full Cover, Izuku uses
                        a fighting style focused on kicks, which are naturally stronger
                        than arms.</li>
                        <li>One For All: Full Coverage - 20%: Midoriya uses 20% of the
                          full power of his quirk and distributes it throughout his body,
                          gaining an even greater boost in power and speed. It doesn't
                          break his bones, but it does put quite a bit of strain on his
                          body.</li>
                          <li>One For All: Full Coverage - 30%: Midoriya uses 30% of the
                            full power of his quirk and distributes it throughout his body,
                            gaining an even greater boost in power and speed. Midoriya was
                            able to use this technique near the end of his first year at UA,
                            during the war with the Paranormal Liberation Front.</li>
                            <li>One For All: Full Coverage - 100% (ワン・フォー・オール フルカウル Wan Fō Ōru Furu Kauru 100 Pāsento):
                              Izuku activates his Quirk at full power, covering his entire body, gaining a huge increase
                              in speed and strength, allowing him to easily overwhelm really strong
                              enemies. This technique was first used to protect Eri. The increase in power
                              appears to give him fire trails emanating from his eyes. Being in direct
                              contact with Eri, Midoriya is able to be in this mode without harming his body at all.
                              Since Eri has the ability to "rewind" a person's body condition,
                              any damage done to Izuku's body when using One For All will be 100%
                              negated by Eri's Quirk, which proved useful in his fight against
                              the villain.</li>
                              <li>Froppy Style (フロッピースタイル Furoppīsutairu): Using a black
                                whip, Izuku releases a "tendril" from his mouth and uses it in
                                the same way Tsuyu does with his tongue.</li>
                                <li>Full Shot (全ぜん開かい Zenkai): Using a smoke screen, Izuku
                                  activates it with maximum power to instantly release a large
                                  amount of smoke.</li>
                                  <li>Spot Focus (一いっ点てん特とっ化か Itten Tokka): Using a black whip,
                                    it quickly fires a "tendril" at a specific target to attack
                                    them.</li>
                                    <li>Artificial 100 Percent (疑ぎ似じ 100%パーセント Giji Hyaku-pāsento):
                                      Izuku uses 45% One For All, and stores kinetic energy with Fa Jin.
                                      By doing this, he can achieve the blinding speed of using One For All
                                      at 100%, without the accompanying recoil.</li>
                                      <li>Black Chain (黒こく鎖さ Kokusa): By combining the Black Whip and Fa Jin,
                                        Izuku can create a chain that he can use to bind his opponent.</li>
                                        <li>Transmission (トランスミッション Toransumisshon): Izuku rushes
                                          towards his opponent and strikes them multiple times, with each
                                          strike increasing the speed shift gear affecting his opponent.</li>
                                          <li>Overdrive (五速オーバードライブ Ōbādoraibu): Izuku uses Speed
                                            Shift and Fa Jin on himself, increasing his speed and strength
                                            to catch up with his opponent and unleash powerful attacks on
                                            them. The power he unleashes is described as 120% One For All.</li>

  <p>
  One For All (ワン・フォー・オール Wan Fō Ōru): Izuku's quirk,
  which he received from All Might. This Quirk gives him superhuman
  strength, agility, and mobility by channeling power through his body.
   Thanks to this Quirk, Izuku increases his physical abilities
   (strength, speed, endurance and agility) to superhuman levels.
   <p>In the early days of using One For All, Izuku caused enormous damage
  to himself, including breaking his limbs. Recently, Izuku's reflexes
  and speed have improved significantly, allowing him to hold his own
  against particularly strong opponents for longer. Izuku can focus his
  accumulated power in one part of his body or distribute it evenly
  throughout his body, although concentrating the power in one part
  of the body causes a huge strain, causing him considerable pain.
  Currently, Midoriya can control 45% of his Quirk's full power without
   breaking limbs, but his normal output is 30%.</p>
   <p>The "core" of One For All, which was hidden behind the physical
  strength accumulated over several generations, contains the quirks
   of its past owners. This gives Izuku the opportunity to use the
   quirks of past owners of One For All. He can even use multiple
   learned quirks at the same time, giving him even more options
   in battle. Known One For All Quirks Midoriya has gained so far:</p>
   <ul >
     <li> Speed Switch (変へん速そく Hensoku): A quirk belonging to the
     second owner of One For All. This Quirk allows one to change the
     speed of an object the wearer touches.</li>
     <li> Fa Jin (発はっ勁けい Hakkei): A quirk that belonged to the third
     owner of One For All. This Quirk allows Izuku to store and create
      kinetic energy while performing movements, which subsequently
      allows him to use the accumulated energy in an explosive burst
      of speed and power.</li>
      <li> Premonition of Danger (危き機き感かん知ち Kiki kanchi): A quirk
     belonging to Hikage Shinomori, the fourth owner of One For All.
      The Quirk allows its user to sense threats in their surrounding
      area. Izuku describes its effect as a stabbing feeling in the head.</li>
      <li> Black Whip (黒鞭クロムチ Kuro Muchi): A quirk owned by Daigoro
     Banjo, the fifth wielder of One For All. Allows you to create
     whips of dark energy and use them to grab objects at long
     distances, as well as pull the user towards these objects.</li>
     <li> Smokescreen (煙えん幕まく Enmaku): A quirk belonging to En,
     the sixth owner of One For All. Allows Izuku to create a thick
      cloud of smoke from his body. This smoke can cover a very
      large area and obscure the view of opponents.</li>
      <li> Flight (浮ふ遊ゆう Fuyū): A quirk owned by Nana Shimura,
     the seventh owner of One For All. This quirk allows Izuku
     to maintain his position and move in the air.</li>
   </ul>

    <h2 class="subtitle">Appearance</h2>
    <p class="paragraph-text">
    Izuku is a slightly short guy for his age with a rounded face,
     small symmetrical freckles on both cheeks, large green eyes and
     dark green curly hair that sticks out in different directions and
     casts noticeable shadows on itself. All these characteristic features
     give him a very sloppy and at the same time energetic appearance.
     He was originally quite thin, but after training with All Might,
     he gained well-developed muscles.
     <p>During his junior high school years, he wore a Japanese black Gakuran uniform with yellow buttons.
      In UA, he wears the standard men's uniform: a light gray jacket over a white shirt and dark green pants,
       along with a red tie that he doesn't tie properly. Additionally,
       Izuku always wears tall red boots with white soles.</p>
<p>Izuku's first hero costume consisted of a light green jumpsuit with a red belt,
black elbow and knee pads, white gloves, and his signature red boots.
He also wore a mask with ear-like protrusions reminiscent of All Might's hairstyle and
a respirator in the shape of a smile. This suit was severely damaged during his training battle with Katsuki Bakugo,
 resulting in Izuku being forced to have it repaired.</p>
 <p>Subsequently, Izuku's heroic costume underwent some changes,
 which is why it began to look more durable and combat-ready.
 The green color has become darker, the white panels on his torso have become dark gray,
  his knee pads have become significantly longer and now extend to his hips,
   and his gloves are decorated with blue stripes. His respirator is now metal and
   has eight small holes. Also in this costume, Izuku does not wear his mask,
   although it is still present and now resembles a hood.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Personality</h2>
<p class="paragraph-text">
  Izuku is a very timid, reserved and polite guy. At the beginning of the story,
  due to being bullied as a child for being born without a Quirk, he looks stiff and
  expressionless, especially compared to Katsuki.
   As a teenager, Izuku was the target of bullying,
   the main instigator of which was Bakugou.
   But despite this, he continues to consider Katsuki his friend,
    and after entering U.A. and defeating him in the Trial Battle, he became more confident and brave.
  <p>Izuku is also diligent and strong-willed.
  Izuku is incredibly determined. From the moment he decided to become a hero,
  he writes down in his notebooks everything he learns about Heroes and their Quirks,
  including Yuei's students. He is very caring and will never leave someone in trouble,
   even if he knows that he is not strong enough to protect. When someone is in trouble,
    Izuku always tries to help, even though it's none of his business. Often he does this on a whim,
     without immediately realizing what happened.</p>
